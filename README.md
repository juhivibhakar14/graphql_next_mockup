# graphql_next_mockup
GraphQL API using Next.js, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL with onDelete: "cascade" relations. Includes user and post management with automatic cleanup of related posts when a user is deleted, reducing the need for manual delete queries. Demonstrates both database-level cascade deletes and application-level delete logic for comparison.
